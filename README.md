# Capacitor parallel RLC Fitting

## Equivarent Circuit


## how to fit
In each frequency, the cost function is 
$$ f_{cost} = \Sigma_{i,j} \left( s_{i,j}^{ref} - s_{i,j}^{lumped} \right) $$

$s^{ref}, s^{lumped}$ is reference data obtained from `simsurfing` and calculated data from parallel RLC circuit.
